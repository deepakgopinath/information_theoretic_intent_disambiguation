# Information Theoretic Characterization of Control Modes for Intent Disambiguation


## Project Description

This github repo contains the MATLAB code for all point robot simulations in the ICRA 2020 submission, titled "Information Theoretic Characterization of Control Modes for Intent Disambiguation". 

## How to Run Code

1. Launch MATLAB. 
2. Run script_simulate.m inside PointRobotSimulation folder. 

## Folder Descriptions

R2, R3, SE2 and SE3 each correspond to the different spaces in which the point robot simulations were performed.
